## :dart: Objective

For my first computer vision project, I chose to participate to a classical competition on Kaggle: identify digits from the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset.

## :male_detective:	Description
In my notebook, I started with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model which had good results. Then, for the competition I created a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in order to reach an accuracy of 0.99128.
